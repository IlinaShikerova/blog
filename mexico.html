    <h4>What NOT to Do in Mexico</h4>
    <div id="info"><p>
      So you’ve figured out the best things to do in Mexico — but now you want
      to know what NOT to do in Mexico. Ha! No worries. That’s a very good
      thing. I’m sure you don’t want to make any major mistakes on your trip!
      Mexico is a country I love dearly and one of my favorite places in the
      world. I try to get there at least once a year, and I’ve spent time living
      there. I’ve written guides about what not to do in New York or Croatia.
      Those have a lot of unusual tips. Mexico is different, though. So much of
      what tourists get wrong when they visit Mexico stems from one issue — that
      Americans are continuously fed media that depicts Mexico as a dangerous
      place. Once you get over those fears, you’ll be on your way to a much
      better trip.

    <h4>The ABSOLUTE Best Things to Do in Oaxaca, Mexico</h4>
    <p>
      Looking for the best things to do in Oaxaca? I’ve got you covered! Oaxaca
      is one of my favorite places in Mexico, and I think it’s one of the most
      special cities in Latin America. Oaxaca (pronounced wa-HA-ca) ticks all
      the boxes — it’s an incredibly beautiful city, it’s an endlessly
      interesting city; it’s large enough to have tons of things to do but small
      enough to get around on foot; and the value for money is EXCELLENT. Oh,
      and did I mention it’s a culinary nirvana? I arrived in Oaxaca a
      sleep-deprived zombie, thanks to taking the 10-hour overnight bus from San
      Cristóbal de las Casas. The sun shone beautifully, warming my face. A
      strong coffee at a cafe on the Zócalo and a Oaxacan tamale, steamed in a
      banana leaf and filled with black mole, brought me back to life. I
      people-watched with a smile on my face. I was hooked on this city already.
      I spent a full week in Oaxaca, exploring it top to bottom. Mexico is one
      of my favorite countries in the world, and I love to visit every winter
      when possible. Now I’m considering spending a winter or two in Oaxaca,
      just to enjoy it for longer.
