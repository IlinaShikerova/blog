    <h5>
      My name is Ilina Shikerova and I travel the world for a living.<br />
      I’ve been shipwrecked in Indonesia. I’ve gone swimming in the frigid
      waters of Antarctica. <br />
      I’ve partied with Ernest Hemingway lookalikes in Key West, cheered on the
      world air guitar champions in Finland, and danced until dawn with
      fire-throwing Vikings in the Shetland Islands.<br />
      And I’ve traveled alone in places as far-flung as Lebanon, Colombia, and
      South Africa.<br />
      I’m a 29-year-old woman originally from the Boston area. After four years
      of establishing a career in online marketing and a lifetime dreaming of
      traveling the world, I decided that it was time to make it happen.
