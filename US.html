    <h4>12+ Best Day Trips from Boston</h4>
    <div id="info"><p>
      What are the best day trips from Boston? Have I got a post for you! Boston
      is a brilliantly situated city, surrounded by seaside towns, cool beaches,
      and natural wonders. Whether you’re staying in downtown Boston or out in
      the suburbs, whether you’re traveling with kids or on your own, there’s so
      much to see throughout Massachusetts and beyond. And if there’s anything I
      know like the back of my hand, it’s Boston day trips — the ones that are
      worth it (Newburyport! Providence! Portland!), and the ones that are bad
      ideas (don’t even THINK about day tripping to Martha’s Vineyard). I grew
      up 20 minutes outside Boston — Reading, specifically — and spent several
      years living in Boston as an adult. Today, I spend much of the year in the
      Boston area with my family. I feel very lucky to be from New England,
      which is filled with fabulous places to visit, from my beloved Portsmouth,
      New Hampshire, to Provincetown, the funky tip of Cape Cod.

    <h4>33 Best Things to Do in the Berkshires</h4>
    <p>
      What are the best things to do in the Berkshires? This part of Western
      Massachusetts is so special — not just beautiful, but idyllic, like a
      painting; not just interesting, but one of the most fascinating regions in
      the state. Most people come to Massachusetts to visit Boston, or Cape Cod,
      or Martha’s Vineyard or Nantucket. But there are treasures waiting for you
      if you’re willing to head out west. Despite growing up in Massachusetts,
      I’ve barely seen the Berkshires — I went to summer camp in East Otis for a
      few years, but that’s it. And I know it’s human nature not to visit what’s
      right in front of you. You always assume you’ll be able to do that
      someday, so why do it now? But in 2021, a time when people have been
      looking to closer, local getaways, I decided it was time to visit the
      Berkshires — not only to have fun, but to research extensively, and
      eventually create guides like this one to help you plan your own trips to
      the Berkshires.
